This repository contains the final source code for my Computer Science MSc research dissertation VR project, submitted July 2023.  My research addressed the following topic: _Comparison of teleportation locomotion methods for efficient wayfinding in virtual reality environments._

If you are interested in my code, I recommend starting at: Scripts/NBS_StudyManager.cs

NOTE: this is not the full Unity package and only contains scripts created by the researcher and third-party assets used in the project.
